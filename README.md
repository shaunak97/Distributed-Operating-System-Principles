#Steps to run
1. Unzip the file and navigate inside the folder
2. Open Terminal
3. Run the following command: 
    dotnet fsi --langversion:preview proj1.fsx 1000000 24
  
    Output: 
        [Prints first number of the sequence that forms a perfect square]
               
        Real time: <real time> in ms
        CPU time: <cpu time> in ms
        Cores Used : <cores used in computation>
        (ratio of CPU time to Real Time)
        
        
 #Size of work unit for each worker actor
 
 
    • The work unit considered was k where a sequence of numbers of size k was given to each actor.
    • The actor then squares each of those values of size k and adds it up.
    • Another approach was to simultaneously square all the values from 1 to N by assigning it to actors and then sum up each sequence of size k parallelly.
    • But this would take more time and space, since the boss would need to wait till all the squares are computed by workers and also needs space to store it.

    • For an input of 1000000 it was found that dividing the work to 1000 actors where each actor received 1000 work units, used the most cores delivering the best performance.
    • But when the input N<1000 we create only N actors and assigned 1 work unit for each actor.
    • When 10,000 actors were spawned it was found to be more cumbersome to maintain this number of actors than perform the squaring.



For an input N=1000000 and k=24

| No. of Actors | Work Unit Received by each actor | Cores used |
|---------------|----------------------------------|------------|
| 1000          | 1000                             | 4.84       |
| 10000         | 100                              | 4.59       |
| 100000        | 10                               | 4.08       |
